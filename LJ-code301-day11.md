# LJ Code 301 - Day11

Dear Diary,

Today we learned about single page applications and client side routing with the help of page.js. Basically, a single page application is a single page site that updates the look and feel of it's content after the user clicks on something without having to go through the server. It makes it seem like the information is coming from a different page when it's actually all loaded on one.

We used these methods to then update our portfolio. I finally got mine working after taking five hours to figure out I spelled 'controller' wrong on one of my pages. I like the look of it but I think I need to refactor my code a little bit to make everything a little more smooth.

Originally in my portfolio I used jQuery attached to my nav drop down so after a user clicked their option it would remove all the content except for what they had clicked. It was kind of like a beginner version of the single page application because you could definitely tell I was just hiding content, and with the new SPA style it give more of a feel of different pages. Also, it looks better when you can see what section you're in in the URL.

I haven't opened it in mobile yet now that I think about it, and I'm kind of scared to. Day 11 of breaking my code...
