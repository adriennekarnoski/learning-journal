# LJ Code 301 - Day 5

Dear Diary,

Today I learned about using jQuery to take information entered by a user into a form and create a JSON string that can be copied to the article.js file. We've also been learning about how to make things shorter and faster to get done by using things such as handlebars.js to create templates in out html.

jQuery has been really fun to learn and it makes things a lot easier, but the only thing I don't like is how hard it can be to learn sometimes. With javascript it seemed like once you understood the basic concepts you could look at an example of something you haven't learned yet and have a basic idea of what it meant, but with jquery it's like everything has it's own symbol or short condensed way of being written it's hard to guess what some stuff is until you actually learn it.
