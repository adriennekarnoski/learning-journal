# LJ code 201 - Day 17

Dear Diary,

Over the past few days I have been learning a lot about working in a team, and how to make everyone's ideas work together. Also, I'm learning how much time needs to be spent planning a large project before you start coding it.

There's so many little pieces that need to fit together that you don't even think about. And the more time you spend in the planning phase, the quicker you can get those issues out of the way. It's easier to prepare for issues before they happen than it is to be in the middle of your code and find our something doesn't work.

Overall, working in a team has been really fun, and it's nice to see things from their point of view and have other options about structuring your code. Sometime's you would never write something a certain way until someone shows you how proficient it is.
