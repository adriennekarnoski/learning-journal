# LJ Code 301 - Day 15

Dear Diary,

It is the beginning of project week and I'm finishing all my submissions for class and I must say, I feel like hell.

And not because of class, surprisingly. If anything that was the only thing that went well, and it's hard to not feel like that's the part that missed out the most because I only gave like 75% of my time to it and the other 25% went to countless other crap in my life that couldn't wait for one month for me to be done with class.

So what have I learned today? I learned that at the end of the day I am my own biggest support. Fan club of one, thank you.
