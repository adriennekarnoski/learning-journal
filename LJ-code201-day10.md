# LJ Code 201 - Day 10

Dear Diary,

We're starting our Cookie Pizza project and I think the biggest thing I'm learning is how much I hate CSS. I have to give a shoutout to people who work with it as a career, because for me it just drives me insane.

For the most part, my Cookie Stand project is finished and now I'm just going back and refactoring my code. I like to keep working on it and making it more 'dry' as they call it, and also it's pretty to look at. Who knew there was such a thing as aesthetically pleasing code... There's a book I found that goes deep into the details of refactoring that I look at from time to time, but I haven't spent too much time on it because it's 499 pages and I don't know if I have the brain space for that right now.

Right now I'm learning how to find the motivation to deal with CSS, and I may or may not being writing my journal entry because I'm avoiding it.
