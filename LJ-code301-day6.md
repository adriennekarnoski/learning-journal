# LJ Code 301 - Day 6

Dear Diary,

Today we started learning about AJAX and JSON. We did a lab where create articles based off local storage and worked on pulling information we needed down from the server using AJAX.

It was really interesting, but definitely something that was hard to understand until I could visualize what was happening. The biggest thing I notice was keeping track of what type of data we were working with. Whether it was an array or a string. After that part it was so frustratingly simple because everything was right there the whole time, it's just so important to pay attention to the tiny details.
