# LJ Code 301 - Day 10

Dear Diary,

The past couple days we've been learning about relational data and functional programming. Mostly how to take our code and make it better.

The purpose of a relational model of data is for creating consistent, logical representations of information and consistency. We also learned how to decompose a table into smaller pieces, called normalizing.

After learning about the breakdown of the tables we learned how to put it all back together with inner joins and how the tables reference each other with a foreign key.

On Friday we covered functional programming and topics like the Javascript module pattern, and imperative vs declarative concepts. Also we learned about mutability, or methods that mutate your data, and the opposite, immutability.
Three new methods we learned were .map(), .filter(), and .reduce(), which I've seen used a lot on Code Wars but never actually learned how to use them correctly until Friday. So it was pretty nice to finally start using those.
