# LJ Code 201 - Day 9

Dear Diary,

We are finishing up our lab project with objects as week two comes to a close. As much as it sucked going through it, it was still more fun than dealing with CSS.

As for objects, I think the more we built with them and the bigger the project got, the easier it was to see how everything worked together and why certain things had to be done. I'm still studying all the different parts and trying to make sure I understand everything as we move along.

On the side I'm also working on my pseudocode. I have a bad habit of writing things to down to begin with or writing out something I'm having a problem visualizing, but as soon as I think I know what to do for another part I get to excited and jump straight into writing the code. Which usually results in me doing something wrong and needed to rewrite it anyway. There's surprisingly a lack of example for writing out pseudocode on google, especially when it comes to something visual like a flow chart. Hopefully if I come up with a good enough system I'll be able to share it on slack. So far I've just waisted about 50 sheets of paper. Luckily Washington has a lot of trees.
