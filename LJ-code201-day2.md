# LJ Code 201 - Day 2

Dear Diary,

Today was our second day of school, and I'm happy to say I'm not drowning (yet). We went over the main HTML and CSS stuff covered in the John Duckett book, and it was significantly easier to understand when being taught versus teaching myself. I'm glad I have a general idea of what's going on, but it's nice to get the opinion and suggestions of someone from the field. Google was a lot of help when I was studying, but google can also be full of crap sometimes.

I have to get in the habit of using semantic tags for all my elements, and stop using inline font edits. We learned today to use <span>, which is a totally new idea to me, so I tried to use it as much as I could in our lab today.

I'm curious to see if I can keep the momentum up with Javascript though. In the past we haven't really gotten along, and I'm waiting for it to start giving me attitude.

It's about beer'thirty, and I have reading to do, so I'll talk to you later.
