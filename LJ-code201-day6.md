# LJ Code 201 - Day 6

Dear Diary,

Our brisk walk into learning Javascript has now turned into a full-speed sprint, downhill, with the wind.

We've starting learning objects, which is a whole new ball game. So far the easiest way for me to think of it is like making a person, and all of it's properties are the different variables that are unique to that person, but fall in a category other people would have. Like their height, eye color, hair color... Stuff like that, and the way they are used is a method.

The hardest part so far with object is creating the methods you need inside the object and then applying the different results you get in more methods. Like a snowball affect, where the information you need is available through the previous method.
