# LJ Code 201 - Day 15

Dear Diary,

We are beginning project week, and the biggest thing I am learning right now is working in a team setting. I wouldn't say it necessarily hard to be in a group, but it's a shift in mindset. You can't start messing with a bunch of stuff that isn't a part of your workload, and in the back of your mind you have to keep up with the git workflow.

I really like my group though, but now we just have to finalize our plans and get to work.
