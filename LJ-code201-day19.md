# LJ Code 21 - Day 19

Dear Diary,

Today was our presentation day for our final 201 project, and from it I learned that talking in front of people is not that bad. I still didn't love it, and I wouldn't want it to be a personal hobby or anything. But I also didn't pass out or stutter the whole time I was up there, so I consider it a success.
