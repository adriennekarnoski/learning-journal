# LJ Code 301 - Day 3

Dear Diary,

We've started learning about jQuery, and I haven't decided how I feel about it yet. It's definitely shorter than vanilla Javascript, but sometimes it's like it's too easy and I make a bigger mess than necessary. It is a lot of fun though, I will say that.

I think after spending more time messing around with it, it will get easier to see how everything works. For the most part I'm able to get it to work, but sometimes I don't exactly know how I got it to work.

Also, I can't tell if the Git flow is getting easier or harder. It seems like it should be getting easier, but everyone kind of has their own thing so every day is just slightly different. But I haven't managed to break anything yet or gotten a merge conflict, so I guess that's a good thing.
