# LJ Code 201 - Day 11

Dear Diary,

I'm getting more comfortable with objects and understanding how to use them, but now I'm caught in the struggle of wanting to condense my code done and make it as dry as possible while still remaining in my skill level. I took most of my day figuring out how to keep my Javascript how I imagined it when I probably could have gotten a lot more done if I had wrote everything out in big code blocks. It was really fun, but would probably be more practical when I really know what I'm doing.
