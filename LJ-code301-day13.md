# LJ Code 301 - Day 13

Dear Diary,

Today we deployed our blog article to Heroku, which was far more challenging than I was expecting. At first it didn't really work because of the way our files were set up, but everything went fine after it was fixed.

It was actually nice to have the files messed up at first and then have to fixed them because now I'll know for when I mess my own files up, which I know I'll do plenty of times.

It's cool to be able to post our sites and have them be live so we can have people check them out.
