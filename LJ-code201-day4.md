# LJ Code 201 - Day 4

Dear Diary,

I'm not drowning yet, but I feel like my brain is bleeding.

I feel like I have a 150% better grasp on Javascript already compared to the months I spent teaching myself. I think it's mostly due to the learning style. You never really learn to your full potential when you watch tutorials online or follow along with a course because they basically show you how a problem is solved and then give you the same one to work on. All you have to do is copy what you just saw, step by step. But when you are taught all the essential pieces and then it's up to you to figure the problem out you're kind of forced to figure out why things work or why they don't work. And at the end of the day you actually understand what you are writing.

I manage to break my code a lot, but it's almost more fun that way because I like having to figure out what's wrong. Unless it's a spelling error. That pisses me off every time I figure out that's what's wrong.

I'm excited to start learning functions, even though it will be more ways for me to break stuff.
