# LJ Code 301 - Day 1

Dear Diary,

Today was the first day of 301. We learned about MVC, SMACSS, and responsive web design and a few little things along the way.

I'm excited to start learning about the server, and start using live-server while I'll build code. It's been a big shift in thinking about how everything works, but I enjoy the challenge. Also, I can't wait to start learning more back-end stuff because I hate design so much, but I also don't know how well I'll do. So the curiosity is definitely motivating me to keep moving forward.

We also are starting pair programming more, which I really like, it's just a lot of moving parts to keep track of. Git flow can easily get out of control, but the more I do it the easier it gets.
