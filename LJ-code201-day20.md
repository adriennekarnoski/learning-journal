# LJ Code 201 - Day 20

Dear Diary,

Over the weekend I have been getting a lot of my notes together from 201 and organizing them for reference in 301, just in case I need them. I've also been going through a lot of the work we did during the first few weeks of 201 to see how my style has changed or just see how much better I understand the different topics.

I want to get started on the 301 prework and also read a little bit about the topics we'll be learning, just to have a general idea of everything. I'm definitely looking forward to 301!
