# LJ Code 301 Day - 8

Dear Diary,

Today we learned about SQL and did a review of working with our node server. The review was really nice because my partner and I experienced the same issues as most people yesterday, so having a chance to talk about what went wrong and how to keep it from happening again was really helpful.

Databases are awesome, so far. Also I thought the lab was really really fun, even though I can't say for sure if we got all, if any, of them right. But being about to just go through all the code and see how it all fits together was one of my favorite things we've done this week. See everything from the starter code really makes me wonder if I'll be able to build something that intense one day. Hopefully I can, but right now I'm still just trying to get CSS to do what I want.

I also want to find ways to apply CRUD to my life, just because I like saying create read update and destroy.
