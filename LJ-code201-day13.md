# LJ Code 201 - Day 13

Dear Diary,

Today I learn how frustratingly simple Javascript can be sometimes. We learned about local storage and our lab for the day was storing our votes so that the next time we ran our product survey the amount of votes for products would grow.

We spent most of the day messing around with our data in the console log, using stringify and parsing it back, which looked like the code we needed to write would be a lot harder than we would actually needed. The little group I was working in spent hours trying to figure out what we needed to do, as our code grew longer and longer. As it turns out, we only needed about four lines of code and it would work just fine. The urge to punch my computer was real.

It was one of those "keep it simple, stupid" moments, where it seemed too simple to be true. Sometimes Javascript can be ridiculous.
